# ISC2-CC-Exam-Guide

# Here’s Exactly How I Studied + What I Wish I Knew Earlier

I finally sat for the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam and passed, and I wanted to share my experience for anyone preparing right now. For context: I’m not some seasoned IT professional, I’m just someone who wanted to break into cybersecurity with very basic prior knowledge. This exam is absolutely doable in **2–3 weeks**, but only if you study the right things and understand how this test workss.

## 1. Starting With the Free ISC2 Self-Paced Course

Once you register for the CC exam, you get access to [ISC2’s free training, pre-assessment, post-assessment, and flashcards.](https://www.isc2.org/landing/CC-bundles?utm_source=isc2&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=GBL-CC-bundles&utm_term=ccproductlandingpage&utm_content=training)

Use these. They’re free, structured, and honestly a decent starting point, **but don’t assume the exam is anywhere near the same difficulty level.**

**My advice:**
- Do the pre-assessment  
- Work through the training modules  
- Use the flashcards and make sure you can explain each term in your own words  
- Do the post-assessment multiple times  

Treat this as your **foundation, not your finish line.**

## 2. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn Course + Book

Mike Chapple is practically the unofficial CC professor at this point.

I personally read his [**CC All-in-One book**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oflEMNpX4wPDiufrS0cO8OsVOTLoyrPj/view?usp=sharing) thoroughly — inside out — and that alone filled so many gaps. His [LinkedIn Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/isc-2-certified-in-cybersecurity-cc-cert-prep) is also highly recommended by many people, even though I didn’t take it myself. It’s structured, clean, and aligned extremely well with the exam objectives.

👉 **If you want one strong paid resource, this is the one.**

## 3. (Optional) Thor Pedersen’s Course — My Personal Opinion

I didn’t take [Thor Pedersen’s course](https://www.udemy.com/course/certifiedincybersecurity/) myself, but based on how widely it’s recommended and what I’ve seen, here’s my personal take:

- He goes deeper into explanations, which can help if you feel like concepts aren’t sticking yet.  
- But some parts are broader than what CC requires, so I’d treat this as **optional**, only if you need reinforcement after the basics.

## 4. The REAL MVPs: These YouTube Videos

Not exaggerating — these YouTube playlists helped me more than any mock test ever did.

They don’t just give answers. They teach you **how to think like the exam**, how to break down questions, and what keywords actually matter.

**Watch them in this exact order:**

### 🔹 [Prabh Nair’s ISC2 CC playlists](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0hT6hgexlYw-k6GxQf_DIAPdc96T2MP-) 
Amazing explanations, exam-style thinking.

### 🔹 [Computer Networks Decoded CC Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOxT4hJX5h8)  
Super helpful conceptual reinforcement.

### 🔹 [Cloud Guru Amit CC Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx5_UkGNs24d3e5JV1-fGLOI77w_zrdut)  
Great question breakdowns and keyword spotting.



These three honestly gave me insights that **no textbook did**. Highly, highly recommended.

## 5. Learn *Literally All Types of Attacks*

This deserves special emphasis because it nearly cost me points.

Until the **last night** before my exam, I didn’t even know that social engineering had multiple subdivisions — and that’s just one example.

**Learn:**
- Every single type of attack  
- Variants within each category  
- **What each attack impacts in the CIA triad**  
- Mitigations  
- Real-world context  

Use [**Professor Messer’s Security+ attack videos**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiEptGbnEBc&list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv) — they explain everything clearly.

💡 Knowing attack types deeply will make at least **10–20 questions** dramatically easier.

---

## 6. Mock Tests

I personally didn’t buy any paid mock exams — instead, I revisited all the material I studied. But I *do* think attempting at least **one timed mock** is helpful just to understand pacing.

**Options:**
- Free CC mock tests (Google search)  
- Udemy or LinkedIn practice exams if you prefer paid ones  

Mocks are for **pacing and question style**, not your main learning method.(again, my personal opinion)

---

## 7. Final Cross-Check With the Important Topics Document

Before the exam, I went through this [**consolidated document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLKPSQ0jpf3CyUpX_XcB8ex05ecjPUDT1a90NH7TkyQ/edit?usp=sharing) of essential CC topics.

**Do this.**  
It ensures you aren’t missing anything crucial and gives you a last-minute checklist to reinforce concepts.

# Final Advice

### **1. The ISC2 training ≠ the actual exam difficulty.**  
Don’t rely on the course alone.

### **2. Do NOT underestimate this exam.**  
It’s foundational, yes — but only if you already know networking + basic security.

### **3. Focus on understanding the *why* and *how*, not just the what.**  
Scenario questions demand reasoning, not memorization.

### [**4. Learn the exam structure — timing, number of questions, weighting.**](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc/cc-certification-exam-outline#Domain%201:%20Security%20Principles)  
You should know exactly what to expect.

### **5. In the exam, MANY questions will have two answers that feel right.**  
This is intentional.

When that happens:
- Choose the answer that aligns with **security best practice**  
- Think like ISC2: **protect people → protect data → protect systems**  
- Prioritize **preventing harm** over fixing after the fact  
- Pick the **more high-level, governance-focused** option when unsure  

This strategy helped me break ties every time.

### **6. Don’t overwhelm yourself.**  
This certification builds your base for many other cybersecurity certs.  
Study smart, pick the right resources, and take your time.
